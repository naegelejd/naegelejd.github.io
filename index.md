[![](joe.png "Preparing for my wedding reception")](https://github.com/naegelejd)
I am a Senior Engineer at Grier Forensics, located in the Baltimore, MD area.
I am currently working on a large-scale internal project using prominent
open source software frameworks to solve problems related to digital forensics
and the web.

Previously, I was a software developer for the Functional MRI Facility at the
National Institute of Mental Health. My work there consisted of website
development, database design, development of medical image reconstruction
software, and construction of various end-user command-line tools.

In my spare time I enjoy studying programming language design and runtime
implementations. I also like learning *new* programming languages and APIs,
experimenting with embedded systems, playing with Android, and hacking on
website backends.
