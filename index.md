Joe Naegele is a Senior Software Engineer at Grier Forensics, where he has led
development of an analytics platform for large scale (80 TB) web data developed
for the US Air Force, and of Great DANE, a cross-platform suite of tools for
email security, and led enhancements to Grier Forensics' advanced forensics
acceleration system.

Joe is experienced in C++, Java, Scala, Go, Python, the Apache Spark
cluster-computing framework, and other platforms and languages; has developed
software for Linux, Windows, and Mac OS X; and is proficient in multiple DBMS.

Prior to joining Grier, Joe served as Software Engineer at the Functional
MRI Facility at the National Institutes of Health, where he helped develop
a medical image reconstruction framework using Python and C++, which stored,
converted, and extracted MRI data, provided on-screen visualizations, and
performed statistical analysis. He also helped create the ISMRM format for MRI
datasets, including APIs for C/C++, Python, and MATLAB. His work resulted in
peer-reviewed publication in Magnetic Resonance in Medicine, as well as
a popular open source implementation.

In his spare time, Joe enjoys studying programming language design and
runtime implementations, learning *new* programming languages and APIs,
listening to music and playing guitar. He recently became a father to a
beautiful baby girl.
